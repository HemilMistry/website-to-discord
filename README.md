This allows you to send Discord messages from a localhost server you host from your PC and sends a message in the desired Discord channel.

To run this entire project, run the post.py file and everything should work by itself. Some lines of code may need to be edited to suit your directory and Discord configuration. Project is a work in progress so expect bugs.
